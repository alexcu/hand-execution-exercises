# Convert to PDF

## using Pandoc...

I use [Pandoc](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc) to convert my markdown files into PDF.

You can do the same by [installing](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/releases/tag/1.15.0.6) and by running

```
$ pandoc -i some-exercise.md -o some-exercise.pdf
```

## using an online converter...

[Markdown to PDF](http://www.markdowntopdf.com) is an easy online converter that looks simple to use!
