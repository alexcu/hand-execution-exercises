# Function: `???`

Write the code out for the following function in Pascal or C. Then hand execute the code you
have written.

Once you have done that, give a name for this function based on what you think
it does.

## Details

### Return Type

The function returns a **Boolean** value.

### Parameters

- **`data`**, an array of Integers

and, if you decide to use C:

- **`size`**, an Integer

## Steps

1. Assign `result` to the first element in the array `data`.
2. For each element in the array `data`, check if the current value is greater than `result`.
3. If so, `result` is now equal to the current value.

## Hand Execution Data
